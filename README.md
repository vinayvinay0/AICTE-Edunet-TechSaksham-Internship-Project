# AI Healthcare Assistant Chatbot

## Overview
The **AI Healthcare Assistant Chatbot** is an intelligent, interactive chatbot designed to provide basic healthcare-related guidance. It can respond to user queries about symptoms, medication, and appointments using a combination of rule-based logic and a pre-trained **Hugging Face model** for text generation.

This chatbot is built using **Streamlit** for an intuitive web-based interface and leverages **NLP models** to generate responses dynamically.

## Features
- Provides basic responses to healthcare-related queries.
- Uses a **pre-trained Hugging Face model** for AI-generated responses.
- Implements **NLTK** for text processing and filtering.
- Interactive web interface powered by **Streamlit**.
